\begin{frame}[c]{Introduction}
%/////////
\begin{alertblock}{Motivation}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Learning is a key aspect to drive \emph{adaptivity} (by reason under uncertainty)
		\item Intelligent agents improve their performance with \emph{experience}
		\item We would like to improve adaptiveness with raw experience and, hence 
		\item We would like to bring Reinforcement Learning methodology in such kind of systems
	\end{itemize}
\end{alertblock}
\begin{alertblock}{Lecture goals}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Understading the challenges related to the Multi-Agent System (MAS) domain
		\item Show Patterns and Architecture applied in Collective Systems
		\item Hands-on in some pratictal example of Collective Learning
	\end{itemize}
\end{alertblock}
%
\end{frame}

%/////////
\begin{frame}[c, fragile]{Single-Agent Learning}
%/////////
\begin{exampleblock}{What have you seen so far ...}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Markov Decision Process (MDP) to model the agent-environment interactions
		\item Find learning process that eventually lead to an \emph{optimal} policy $\pi^*$
		\item Q-Learning (in general \emph{value-based approaches}) as a prominient algorithm case to reach converge
	\end{itemize}
\end{exampleblock}
\begin{alertblock}{... But this works only under some conditions}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Reward hypothetesis
		\item Full environment observability and Markovian property
		\item Stationary environment
		\item State/Action space should be small enough to be stored in-memory (otherwise, we should leverage function aproximators)
	\end{itemize}	
\end{alertblock}
\end{frame}
%/////////
\begin{frame}{Partial Observable environments}
%/////////
	\begin{alertblock}{Definition}
		Agent does not have a \emph{perfect} and \emph{complete} knowledge perception of the state of the environment
	\end{alertblock}
	\begin{exampleblock}{They are quite typical in (non-)complex systems}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Card-games (poker, black-jack, ...) --- Why?
			\item A driving card
			\item Swarm of drones
		\end{itemize}
	\end{exampleblock}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Partial Observable Environments}
	\begin{exampleblock}{Partial Observable MDP $\mathcal{P}$ (POMDP) \href{https://www.pomdp.org/}{\faLink}}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Agent cannot directly observe the system state, but he can make an \emph{observation} that depend on this state
			\item POMDP is a tuple $(S, A, T, R, \Omega, O)$
			\item $S, A, T, R$ are the same variable described in MDP
			\item $\Omega$ is the set of observation perceive by the agent $\{o_1, ..., o_n\}$
			\item $O$ is the set of conditional probability $O(o | s, a)$
			\item I want to learn a policy that depends on $o$ but maximise a reward function that depends on $s$
			\item The agents need to build a belif state from the observations history
		\end{itemize}
	\end{exampleblock}
\end{frame}
%/////////
\begin{frame}[c]{Non-stationary environments}
%/////////
	\begin{alertblock}{Definition}
		The environment model (e.g. the random variable associated with it) change 
		over the time.
	\end{alertblock}
	\begin{exampleblock}{MDP are Stationary by definition ...}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item ... But, real-case environment dynamics could change over time (e.g. markets, city trafic, routing networks)
			\item Pratically, it seems that RL works well even in this case (online learning)
			\item \emph{But, we loose converge guarantee.}

	\begin{exampleblock}{Considerations}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item If multiple agent exist, but only \textbf{one} agent learn by experience, then it is a single agent problem (e.g. single player videogames)

\section{Learning in CAS}
%===============================================================================
\begin{frame}[c]{Learning in Collective Adaptive System~\footnote[frame]{\fullcite{DBLP:conf/icse/DAngeloGGGNPT19}}}
\begin{exampleblock}{}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The collective goal could be accomplished through competition and/or cooperation 
		\item The system could be heterogenoues or homogeneous
		\item The agent numers is not bounded (openness)
		\item Distributed control -- i.e. no central authority exists
	\end{itemize}
\end{exampleblock}
\end{frame}
%/////////
\begin{frame}[c]{Learning in CAS: Challenges}
	\begin{exampleblock}{CASs are partial observable}
		Each agent could only perceive a part of the system through its sensors.
	\end{exampleblock}
	\begin{alertblock}{Learning in CASs make the environments non-stationary}
		Each agent learns concurrently, so by the eye of the other agent the environment is in continuous changes.
	\end{alertblock}
	\begin{alertblock}{Course of dimensionality -- MAS combinatorial nature}
		When we have to deal with a large number of agents, the overall state-action space is increasing exponentially to the number of agents --- so a central learner cannot solve the learning problem.
	\end{alertblock}
\end{frame}
%/////////
\begin{frame}[c]{Learning in CAS: Challenges}
	\begin{exampleblock}{Multi-Agent credit assigment problem}
		Tipycally, in CAS, a global reward function exisist. But it is hard to understand the influence of a single agent to
		the overall collective behaviour.
	\end{exampleblock}
	\begin{exampleblock}{A lack of a global clock}
		CASs are distributed systems, so a global synchronization clock does not exist, making the standard
		Stachocastic game model quinte inaquate.
	\end{exampleblock}
	\begin{exampleblock}{Sample efficency}
		Action-space and state-space are very large in CASs, so the problem of sample efficiency (i.e. how many samples does the RL need to reach a good policy?)
		arise as in the Deep Learning context. 
	\end{exampleblock}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{On sample efficency: Example of learning time }
	\begin{exampleblock}{A Nowadays problem..}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Nowadays, Deep Learning Techniques are used to train complex neural networks
			\item When applied to Reinforcement Learning, the traning phase requires millions of interactions for an agent to learn
			\item In the Multi Agent Setting is even worst..
			\item In~\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1807-01281} they train 30 agents in 450k games!
		\end{itemize}
	\end{exampleblock}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{On scalability: Single Agent Learner Example}
	\begin{exampleblock}{Learning setting}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item A central agent (i.e. in the cloud? In a server?) see the entire system
			\item Standard RL algorithm (tabular) create a table with the size of $|S \times A|$
			\item But the system-wide action space is the cartesian product of the agent action-space, so the A cardinality is $|A|^N$
			\item With 100 agents, we already reach an action space with more action than the particle in the universe.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{exampleblock}
\end{frame}
%/////////
\begin{frame}{Learning in CAS: Our today focus}
	\begin{alertblock}{Constraints}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Learning in cooperative systems: i.e. each entity share the same reward fuctions
			\item Learning in homogeneous systems: i.e. each entity is interchangable with each other
			\item We consider partial observability not as a core problem
		\end{itemize}
	\end{alertblock}
	\begin{exampleblock}{Homogenous system: Implications}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item The optimal policy is the same for the whole system
			\item During the learning, the system can use different policy (e.g. to reduce sample efficency)
			\item We reduce the action space
			\item We reduce the non-stationarity problem
		\end{itemize}
	\end{exampleblock}

	%	\begin{itemize}
	%		\item Combination of Stochastic games and POMDP
	%		\item $\mathcal{D}$ is a tuple $(N, S, \{A^i\}, P, \{R^i\}, \{{\Omega^{i}}\}O)$
	%		\item For brevity, $\{ \mathfrak{X}^i\} = \{\mathfrak{X}^i\}_{i \in \{1, ..., N\}}$

	\begin{exampleblock}{Dec-POMDP \href{http://rbr.cs.umass.edu/camato/decpomdp/overview.html}{\faLink}}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Extension of POMDP to Multi Agent settings
			\item N agent act in a Markovian environment \emph{but} they perceive only partial information about it (observations)
			\item[\faExclamation] Does not consider homogeneity

			\item Consider an homogeneous population of agents (i.e. same action, observation space and same policy)
			\item Learning lead to single policy that map observation (not history) to action
			\item[\faExclamation] Time continuinig to be synchrnous

\begin{frame}{Learning in CAS: A simplified model}
	\begin{exampleblock}{}		
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Each agent is seen as a tuple $(M, \mathcal{N})$
			\item $M$ is a local markov decision process ($S$ is an observation space in common with the entire system)
			\item The global state system state is unknown
			\item Agents want to learn a policy $\pi(a | s, \mathcal{N})$ to share to the entire system
			\item When agent does not consider neighbours, we call the system as \emph{Independent learners}
			\item When agent consider neighbours action to choose their local action, we call the system as \emph{Joint action learners}

%===============================================================================
\section{Independent Learners}
\begin{frame}{Independent Learners}
	\begin{exampleblock}{Configuration}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Each agent learn concurrently an optimal local policy
			\item This lead to the global optimal policies as an emergent behaviour
			\item The homogeneity is driven by the same reward function and action/observation spaces
			\item More agent lead to a more exploration
			\item Not converge to global optimum, but good pratical performance are founded in various works: \cite{DBLP:conf/atal/TumerA07, DBLP:conf/atal/TumerAW02, DBLP:conf/iros/WangS06}
		\end{itemize}
	\end{exampleblock}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{Independent Learners}
	\begin{exampleblock}{Implications}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item [{\color{teal} \faThumbsUp}] \emph{Scalable}: the learning algorithm does not depend to the system size
			\item [{\color{teal} \faThumbsUp}] \emph{Easy to implement}: the algorithm are the same developed for single agent context
			\item [{\color{teal} \faThumbsUp}] \emph{Offline and Online}: Can be used both at simulation time or at runtime
			\item [{\color{red} \faThumbsDown}] \emph{Increase non-stationarity}: the environment dynamics change continously as the agent learn new policy
		\end{itemize}
	\end{exampleblock}

			\item[{\color{teal} \faThumbsUp}] Simplest extension of Q-Learning into the multi agent domain
			\item[{\color{red} \faThumbsDown}] Need to use Greedy in the Limit of Infinite Exploration (GLIE) policy to reach good performance
			\item[{\color{red} \faThumbsDown}] Complex and aplication dependant parameter tuning
		\end{itemize}
	\end{exampleblock}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Hysteretic Q-Learning\footnote[frame]{\fullcite{matignon2007hysteretic}}}
	\begin{alertblock}{Idea}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Decentralised Q-Learning does not take in consideration non-stationarity problem
			\item An idea could be to apply a \emph{correction} factor that reduce the non-stationarity born for the concurrent learning
			\item Hysteretic Q-Learning uses an \emph{hysteresis} heurestic to handle this problem
			\item It suppose an optimistic behaviour, giving more weight to good action then the bad action (\emph{due to the exploration of nearby agents})
		\end{itemize}
	\end{alertblock}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Hysteretic Q-Learning}
	\begin{exampleblock}{Implementation}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Use two learning factor, $\alpha$ and $\beta$, with $\alpha > \beta$
			\item The Q update is evaluated to consider the goodness of an action/space pair: $\delta(s, a) = r_t + \gamma * argmax_{a'}Q(s_t, a') - Q(s_t, a_t)$
			\item When $\delta > 0$ it means that we improve our experience, so we use $\alpha$ as learning rate, $\beta$ otherwise
			\item The Q update became: $ Q(s_t, a_t) =
			\begin{cases}
				Q(s_t, a_t) + \alpha{\delta(s_t, a_t)} & \text{if} (\delta(s_t, a_t)) > 0 \\
				Q(s_t, a_t) + \beta{\delta(s_t, a_t)} & \text{otherwise}
			\end{cases} $

\begin{frame}{Hysteretic Q-Learning}
	\begin{exampleblock}{}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item[{\color{teal} \faThumbsUp}] It improve standard Q-Learning performance without adding more complexity
			\item[{\color{teal} \faThumbsUp}] It is currently used in Deep Reinforcement Learning to handle complex System
			\item[{\color{red} \faThumbsDown}] It is an heurestic, so it does not have any theoretical guarantes
